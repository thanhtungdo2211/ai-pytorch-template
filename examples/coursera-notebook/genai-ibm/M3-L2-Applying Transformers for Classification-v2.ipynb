Amid this treasure trove of information, a monumental task lies ahead: organizing these historical documents into their relevant topic sections. This strategic curation not only promises to enhance the user experience by delivering more streamlined content but also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into invaluable insights from the past through a modern lens. However, the sheer volume and scope of this undertaking calls for a sophisticated solution.\n","\n","![Documents Overload](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-GPXX0Y15EN/docs.png)\n","\n","The implementation of an automated machine learning system makes it very efficient. Such a system, equipped with advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, could sift through the vast archives, categorizing articles into their respective topics with remarkable precision. As a result, readers would seamlessly access a wealth of knowledge tailored to their interests, while the editorial team gains newfound agility in content management.\n","\n","In this lab, you will embark on the exciting task of classifying news articles for a content search engine. The goal is to build a model that can automatically categorize news articles into different topics or classes, enabling the search engine to deliver relevant content to users efficiently. To achieve this, you will leverage the powerful torchtext library, which simplifies the process of creating a dataset for text classification analysis.\n","\n","With torchtext, you'll have the flexibility to access and preprocess raw news data effortlessly. The library enables you to convert text strings into torch.Tensors, which are essential for training machine learning models. By using torchtext's convenient functionalities, you can set up an efficient data processing pipeline that prepares your text data for classification.\n","\n","Throughout this tutorial, you will demonstrate how to effectively shuffle and iterate through the processed data using torch.utils.data.DataLoader.
